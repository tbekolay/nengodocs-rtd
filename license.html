<p><strong>6.1</strong> This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of Applied Brain Research Inc. excluding its conflicts
of law provisions. Under certain circumstances, the governing law in
this section might be superseded by the United Nations Convention on
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (&#8220;UN Convention&#8221;) and
the parties intend to avoid the application of the UN Convention to
this Agreement and, thus, exclude the application of the UN Convention
in its entirety to this Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>6.2</strong> This Agreement sets out the entire agreement between You and
Us for Your Contributions to Us and overrides all other agreements or
understandings.</p>
<p><strong>6.3</strong> If You or We assign the rights or obligations received through
this Agreement to a third party, as a condition of the assignment,
that third party must agree in writing to abide by all the rights and
obligations in the Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>6.4</strong> The failure of either party to require performance by the
other party of any provision of this Agreement in one situation shall
not affect the right of a party to require such performance at any
time in the future. A waiver of performance under a provision in one
situation shall not be considered a waiver of the performance of the
provision in the future or a waiver of the provision in its entirety.</p>
<p><strong>6.5</strong> If any provision of this Agreement is found void and
unenforceable, such provision will be replaced to the extent possible
with a provision that comes closest to the meaning of the original
provision and which is enforceable. The terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement shall apply notwithstanding any failure of essential
purpose of this Agreement or any limited remedy to the maximum extent
possible under law.</p>
