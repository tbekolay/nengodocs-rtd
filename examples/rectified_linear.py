# # Adding new objects to Nengo
# 
# It is possible to add new objects
# to the Nengo reference simulator.
# This involves several steps and the creation
# of several objects.
# In this example, we'll go through these steps
# in order to add a new neuron type to Nengo:
# a rectified linear neuron.
# 
# ## Step 1: Create a frontend Neurons subclass
# 
# The `RectifiedLinear` class is what you will use
# in model scripts to denote that a particular ensemble
# should be simulated using a rectified linear neuron
# instead of one of the existing neuron types (e.g., `LIF`).
# 
# Normally, these kinds of frontend classes exist
# in either `nengo/objects.py` or `nengo/neurons.py`.
# Look at these files for examples of how to make your own.
# In this case, becuase we're making a neuron type,
# we'll use `nengo.neurons.LIF` as an example
# of how to make `RectifiedLinear`.

class RectifiedLinear(nengo.neurons.NeuronType):  # Neuron types must subclass `nengo.Neurons`
    """A rectified linear neuron model."""
    
    # We don't need any additional parameters here;
    # gain and bias are sufficient. But, if we wanted
    # more parameters, we could accept them by creating
    # an __init__ method.
    
    def gain_bias(self, max_rates, intercepts):
        """Return gain and bias given maximum firing rate and x-intercept."""
        gain = max_rates / (1 - intercepts)
        bias = -intercepts * gain

    def step_math(self, dt, J, output):
        """Compute rates in Hz for input current (incl. bias)"""
        output[...] = np.maximum(0., J)


# ## Step 2: Create a backend Operator subclass
# 
# The `Operator` (located in `nengo/builder.py`) defines
# the function that the reference simulator will execute
# on every timestep. Most new neuron types and learning rules
# will require a new `Operator`, unless the function
# being computed can be done by combining several
# existing operators.
# 
# In this case, we will make a new operator
# that outputs the firing rate of each neuron
# on every timestep.
# 
# Note that for neuron types specifically,
# there is a `SimNeurons` operator that
# calls `step_math`. However, we will
# implement a new operator here to demonstrate
# how to build a simple operator.

        # they read, set, update, and increment

        self.updates = [output]
        self.sets = []
        self.incs = []
        
    # If we needed additional signals that aren't in one of the
    # reads, updates, sets, or incs lists, we can initialize them
    # by making an `init_signals(self, signals, dt)` method.

        """Return a function that the Simulator will execute on each step.

# ## Step 3: Create a build function
# 
# In order for `nengo.builder.Builder`
# to construct signals and operators
# for the Simulator to use,
# you must create and register a build function
# with `nengo.builder.Builder`.
# This function should take as arguments
# a `RectifiedLinear` instance,
# some other arguments specific to the type,
# and a `nengo.builder.Model` instance.
# The function should add the approrpiate
# signals, operators, and other artifacts
# to the `Model` instance,
# and then register the build function
# with `nengo.builder.Builder`.
