Nengo creates these models using the principles of the
`Neural Engineering Framework <http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/research/nef.html>`_.
The first set of examples explains these three principles:
*representation*, *transformation*, and *dynamics*.

For a summary of these principles, see the following example:

.. toctree::

   examples/nef_summary

The following examples give a more detailed presentation:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   representation
   transformation
   dynamics

Putting these three principles together allows us to scale
these examples up to larger networks that do more complex functions.
Below are some of these complex functions,
as well as other examples that we hope will be helpful
as reference when building your own Nengo models.
